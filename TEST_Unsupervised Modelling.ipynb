    "- **Clustering**: \n",
    "Clustering is an unsupervised learning method that groups similar data points together based on the categorical attributes. There are several clustering algorithms available, including k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: \n",
    "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be used to identify the underlying patterns in the categorical data. PCA transforms the categorical attributes into a lower-dimensional space, where the new dimensions are orthogonal and capture the most variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Association Rule Mining**: \n",
    "Association rule mining is a technique used to discover frequent co-occurrences or correlations between categorical attributes. It can be used to identify relationships between different attributes and discover interesting patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)**: \n",
    "SOMs are a type of artificial neural network that can be used for clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data. SOMs are useful for discovering hidden structures and patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**it's important to note that unsupervised learning methods cannot make predictions on new data, as they do not have a target variable to train on. Instead, they can be used for exploratory analysis and to gain insights into the data.**\n",
